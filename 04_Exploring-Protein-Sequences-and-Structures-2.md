# Goals of this Manual
- Introduce researchers to working with protein sequences and structures using Biopython and Chimera

## Benefits of Scripting for Analysis
While examining individual sequences and structures can be useful, we often need to perform a large analysis on many sequences/structures.  In these cases, scripting the analysis can ensure consistency, reproducibility and save countless hours "doing it manually".

Here a collection of sample analysis are linked.  Here scripting is done with Jupyter notebooks; however, it is important to note this is advised but not required.  Analysis using Jupyter notebooks will generally be easier to share.  
A downside is that Jupyter notebooks are harder to version control in a clear manner. For large amounts of custom code, I suggest keeping the code version controlled as proper script files and imported for usage in notebooks.
